Having grown up in the Netherlands, I completed my undergraduate degree in International Business Administration at Tilburg University. Although I enjoyed the generalist nature of my degree, I decided to further specialise in finance through an exchange programme to the National University of Singapore. Over the course of six months, I developed a passion for the field of finance and realised that I would like to work and study in an international environment. 

Therefore, I took a gap year to acquire work experience in the field of finance and prepare my application for a masterâ€™s degree abroad. During this period, I completed corporate finance internships at de Volksbank, KPMG and J.P.Morgan. My personal highlight of these internships was my close involvement in the closing of a $1bn minority investment in a Dutch FIG sector and ESG company. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed gaining exposure to various industries and businesses and performing in-depth financial analyses, I am currently re-orientating towards a career in the field of consulting or private equity. I am drawn by the opportunity to gain client exposure and directly see the impact of my work. In my personal time, I love traveling, skiing, football and playing the alto saxophone.
