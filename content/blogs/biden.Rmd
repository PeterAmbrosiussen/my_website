## Research question: 
What is the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since Joe Biden got into office?

## Source:

## Underlying analysis

### What is the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since Joe Biden got into office?

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
library(infer)

```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Convert dates from string to date-time
approval_polllist %>%
  select(modeldate, startdate, enddate, createddate, timestamp)%>%
  mutate(poll_date = mdy(createddate), modeldate_as_date = mdy(modeldate), start = mdy(startdate), end = mdy(enddate))

#Cannot convert timestamp directly into date-time because of formatting, split into two vectors, reverse order, re-concatenate, convert to date-time
s1 <- stringr::str_split_fixed(approval_polllist$timestamp, " ", n=2)[,1]
s2 <- stringr::str_split_fixed(approval_polllist$timestamp, " ",n=2)[,2]
times <- dmy_hms(paste(s2, s1, sep = "T"))

glimpse(times)
approval_polllist %>%
  add_column(times)
```

Below we calculated the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since Joe Biden got into office, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, which is why we use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r trump_margin, out.width="100%", fig.width = 12}
# Create plot here
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>%
  select(approve, disapprove, enddate) %>%
  mutate(net_approval = approve - disapprove, end_date = mdy(enddate), week = week(end_date)) 

newap_list <- approval_polllist %>%
  group_by(week)%>%
  summarize(avg_netapp=mean(net_approval),
              count=n(),
              sdev=sd(net_approval),
              SErr=sdev/sqrt(count),
              t_crit = qt(0.975, count-1),
              CI_low = avg_netapp - t_crit*SErr,
              CI_high= avg_netapp + t_crit*SErr)

  ggplot(newap_list, aes(x = week, y = avg_netapp))+
  geom_point(colour = "orangered1")+
  geom_line(colour = "orangered1")+
  geom_smooth(colour = "blue", se = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "orange", size = 3)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-15, 10, by = 2.5))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(13,26), limits = c(3, 40))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=CI_low, ymax=CI_high) ,fill="grey", alpha=0.2, colour = "orangered1", outline.type = "both")+
  labs(title = "Estimating approval margin (approve - disapprove) for Joe Biden", subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls", x = "Week of the year", y = "Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)")+
  theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.border = element_blank())
```

The confidence interval in week 3 was much wider than during any other time of 2021, but especially week 25. Trump supporters had stormed the capital on 6 January. The aftermath of this fallout probably led to the significantly increased width of the confidence interval. Another explanation could be that Biden assumed the presidency around that time and respondents of the survey could not base their approval on actual political action Biden had undertaken at the time. Week 25 was at the end of June and the 4th of July was coming up. The national holiday in the United States was likely the force behind the smaller confidence interval. Besides, Biden had ordered a military strike on Iran-backed militia in Iraq and Syria, which might be another reason for the decreased width of the confidence interval as military action against a common enemy unites a nation.
