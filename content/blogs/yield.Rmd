## Research questions: 
1. What are the Yields on US rates by duration since 1960?
2. What are the monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis?
3. What are the 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999?
4. What is the spread and can it help predict recessions?

## Underlying analysis

### What are the Yields on US rates by duration since 1960?

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
library(skimr)
```

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```
Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!

```{r, fig.width=16, fig.height=10}
yield_curve  %>% 
  mutate(duration=factor(duration, levels=c("3-Month Treasury Bill", "6-Month Treasury Bill","9-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate","3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate","20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, color=duration), legend.position="none") +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ duration, ncol=2)+
  labs(title="Yields on US treasury rates since 1960",
       y="%",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

### What are the onthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis?

```{r, fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
yield_curve_2 <- yield_curve  %>%
  mutate(year=factor(year(date)), maturity=factor(maturity, levels=c("3m", "6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y")))

yield_curve_2 %>%
  filter(date>="1999-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=maturity, y=value, group=date, color=year), legend.position="none") +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol=4)+
  labs(title="US yield curve",
       y="Yield %",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

### What are the 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999?

```{r, fig.width=12}
yield_curve_3 <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(date>="1999-01-01", maturity =="3m"| maturity=="10y") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=value,color=duration,group=maturity))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-Month and 10-Year US Treasury Rates since 1999",
       x="",
       y="%",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

yield_curve_3
```

### What is the spread and can it help predict recessions?

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30")
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

```{r, fig.width=15}
yield_curve_3m <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(maturity =="3m")

yield_curve_10y <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(maturity =="10y") %>% 
  left_join(yield_curve_3m, by="date") %>% 
  mutate(spread=value.x-value.y,
         up=ifelse(spread>0, spread, 0),
         down=ifelse(spread<0, spread,0),
         up_ribbon=ifelse(spread>0, spread, NA),
         down_ribbon=ifelse(spread<0, spread, NA)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=spread))+
  geom_line()+
geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0,ymax = up ),fill="#ACC5E6",alpha=1, group = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = down , ymax = 0),fill="#C99B9D",alpha=1, group = 1)+
  geom_rug(aes(y = down_ribbon), position = "stack", color = "#C99B9D", sides = "b", na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = NA) + # use position "stack" to make the tick intervals equal
  geom_rug(aes(y = up_ribbon), position = "stack", color = "#ACC5E6", sides = "b", na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = NA)+
    theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. treasury rates",
       subtitle="difference in % points, monthly averages.
       Shaded areas correspond to recessions",
       y="difference (10 year - 3 month) yield in %",
       caption="Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis")

yield_curve_10y  

shade <- recessions %>% 
  data.frame(start=c("From"),
end=c("To"))

  geom_rect(data=shade, aes(xmin="From", ymax="To",ymin=-3, ymax=10,color="grey", size=0.5, alpha=0.2))
